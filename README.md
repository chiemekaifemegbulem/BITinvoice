## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

## Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/alexaorrico/AirBnB_clone.git"`
* Access AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
* Run hbnb(interactively): `./console` and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`

## File Descriptions
[console.py](console.py) - the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter. 
List of commands this console current supports:
* `EOF` - exits console 
* `quit` - exits console
* `<emptyline>` - overwrites default emptyline method and does nothing
* `create` - Creates a new instance of`BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id
* `destroy` - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). 
* `show` - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
* `all` - Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. 
* `update` - Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). 

#### `models/` directory contains classes used for this project:
[base_model.py](/models/base_model.py) - The BaseModel class from which future classes will be derived
* `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - Initialization of the base model
* `def __str__(self)` - String representation of the BaseModel class
* `def save(self)` - Updates the attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
* `def to_dict(self)` - returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of the instance

Classes inherited from Base Model:
* [amenity.py](/models/amenity.py)
* [city.py](/models/city.py)
* [place.py](/models/place.py)
* [review.py](/models/review.py)
* [state.py](/models/state.py)
* [user.py](/models/user.py)

#### `/models/engine` directory contains File Storage class that handles JASON serialization and deserialization :
[file_storage.py](/models/engine/file_storage.py) - serializes instances to a JSON file & deserializes back to instances
* `def all(self)` - returns the dictionary __objects
* `def new(self, obj)` - sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
* `def save(self)` - serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
* ` def reload(self)` -  deserializes the JSON file to __objects

#### `/tests` directory contains all unit test cases for this project:
[/test_models/test_base_model.py](/tests/test_models/test_base_model.py) - Contains the TestBaseModel and TestBaseModelDocs classes
TestBaseModelDocs class:
* `def setUpClass(cls)`- Set up for the doc tests
* `def test_pep8_conformance_base_model(self)` - Test that models/base_model.py conforms to PEP8
* `def test_pep8_conformance_test_base_model(self)` - Test that tests/test_models/test_base_model.py conforms to PEP8
* `def test_bm_module_docstring(self)` - Test for the base_model.py module docstring
* `def test_bm_class_docstring(self)` - Test for the BaseModel class docstring
* `def test_bm_func_docstrings(self)` - Test for the presence of docstrings in BaseModel methods

TestBaseModel class:
* `def test_is_base_model(self)` - Test that the instatiation of a BaseModel works
* `def test_created_at_instantiation(self)` - Test created_at is a pub. instance attribute of type datetime
* `def test_updated_at_instantiation(self)` - Test updated_at is a pub. instance attribute of type datetime
* `def test_diff_datetime_objs(self)` - Test that two BaseModel instances have different datetime objects
